      <description>Steven Pederson, Principal Developer
Softways™ originated as a San Jose, California based developer and publisher of Macintosh software. Over the years it shifted to developing both Macintosh and Windows software released under the names of other companies. Finally, I headed for the beach: the Pacific Beach community of San Diego, California, where Softways™ remains today.
Recently, the focus shifted to advanced mobile platforms and I fell in love with iOS as it powers the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch.</description>
